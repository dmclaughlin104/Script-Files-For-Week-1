I'm having difficulty with getting GitHub to commit my full Unity projects and end up with a 'fatal error' each time.

I've flagged this with Darragh and we haven't been able to find a solution immediately but hope to resolve it by next week.

In the meantime, here is a GitHub containing the main scripts I produced while following the Create with Code Tutorials.

NOTE
In Prototype 1 I was able to implement the camera switch and also included a third rerversing camera option (swapping between them with the '1', '2' & '3' buttons) for single player
HOWEVER I haven't been able to get this to work properly in the local 2 player split screen. With more time I know I could work it out...

Thanks,
Damien
